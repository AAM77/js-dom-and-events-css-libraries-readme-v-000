# Introduction to Basscss

## Objectives

1. Explain how classes guide our approach to styles
2. Describe the main components of Basscss

## Outline

This lesson can be a quick run through the Basscss documentation. Linger a bit on layout; don't stress style too much.

We want students to feel comfortable with a flexbox-based grid layout.
